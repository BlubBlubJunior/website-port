        In this project, I collaborated with a team consisting of one artist (originally four), one dev (originally three), 
        and one mv. We received a request from a museum to create a game with a somber or thought-provoking theme, 
        and we decided on the concept of suicide. As a result, 
        we developed a 3D first-person puzzle game in which players search for a gun with the intention of exploring the theme of difficult decisions and their consequences.

        <div class="learned1">
            In this project, I've learned a lot, from creating animations in Unity to understanding the importance of various game elements. 
            Additionally, I gained knowledge about implementing interactive features and handling pick-up items in games.

        If I spend another 5 to 10 hours on this project, 
        I'm going to make it better. I'll add helpful information in the waiting room about self-harm.
         I'll fix the main menu to make it easier to use. I'll also make sure the controls for moving and looking around are smoother.
          And to make the game more fun, I'll add exciting stuff like cool puzzles or a better story.
