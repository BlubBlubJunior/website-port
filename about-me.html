        <div class="AboutMe">I'm Ruben Kossen, a 19-year-old from Schagen, Netherlands, and I'm passionate about Unity game development.
            I enjoy creating challenging games that require strategic thinking, like Total War and Europa Universalis IV. 
            In my free time, I'm a fan of anime and manga, and I draw inspiration from their storytelling techniques.</div>
        <div class="AboutMe">I pursued game development to turn my passion into a career, with the original goal of creating games like Total War. 
            However, I discovered a talent for coming up with unique game ideas and solving coding problems, which is what drives me today.
             The coding process challenges me to experiment with new techniques and ideas, 
             resulting in the rewarding experience of seeing a game come to life from a simple concept.</div>
