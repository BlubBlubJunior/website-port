      <div class="whatitabout">What's it about</div>
      <div class="whatitabouttext">This project is a remake of "Ori and the Will of the Wisps," 
        and in our version, we created a 10-second video scene from scratch. 
        We had to design everything shown in the video, including the background music.
         I believe it turned out quite well.</div>
      
      <div class="container">
        <div class="learned">What have I learned</div>
        <div class="learned1">I learned more about incorporating music into games and gained a better understanding of 
          coding in general, including what's essential and what isn't.

        <div class="Whattofix">What could I fix</div>
        <div class="fix">If I had an extra 5 to 10 hours, I'd address some movement issues and improve the overall appearance of the game map.</div>
      </div>
      <div class="fixcontainer">
        <div class="Whattofix">On what did I work</div>
        <div class="fix">In this project, I worked on implementing a health bar and a healing ability, unfortunately, the healing 
          ability didn't make it into the final game. I also contributed to the walking mechanics, respawn systems, and the music, as well as handling various smaller tasks.</div>
